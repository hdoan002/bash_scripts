# bash_scripts
A collection of bash scripts that I have made:

1. ssh script
   This is a script that will allow me to ssh into the server of my choice without
   having to type out my entire name.

2. download script?
   

3. Makefile script
   This script will make a basic makefile for me.

4. GitHub script?

5. header/cc script
   THis script will make empty header and cc files.
